I've been called a lot of things... 
creative, strategist, producer, entrepreneur, filmmaker, writer, youtuber, documentarian, "that guy who makes the silly cartoons."

The constants? storytelling and building at the frontier.

Previously founded [Struthless](https://youtube.com/@struthless) + [Studios](https://struthlessstudios.com), [Step One](https://stepone.life). Ex: BBDO.
